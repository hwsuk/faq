This FAQ section aims to cover the topic of payment.

# Which payment methods should I use?

The following payment methods are most commonly used on HWSUK:

| Payment Method | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PayPal Goods and Services** (PP G&S) | **Provides buyer protection** against item not arriving/item not as described. Easy to send payment to another user's PayPal account using only their email address. | PayPal charge **3.4% of the transaction value + 20p** as a fee. They are also introducing a policy wherein they no longer refund fees for returned payments - if a purchase gets refunded, the seller eats the fee. |
| **Bank transfer** (BT) | Direct transfer to a UK bank account. Requires only the sort code, account number and the name on the account. No fees. | **No buyer protection.** Your bank is very unlikely to help you if you're scammed. |
| **PayPal Friends and Family** (PP F&F) | Easy to send payment to another user's PayPal account using only their email address. | **No buyer protection.** PayPal will not help you if you are scammed. |
